"""The instant season predictor: play the rest of the IPL out, as often as you like.

Nothing here writes. The page hands back a set of picks - "RCB beat SRH", "match
14 was a no result", "MI 180/5 chasing 176/8" - and this answers with the table
those picks produce and a fresh Monte-Carlo of everything still unpicked. The
admin result path (services/results.py) is the only thing that may touch a
fixture or the points table, and the predictor deliberately shares none of it.

The table is rebuilt from the fixture list every time rather than started from
the stored Pointstable, because a simulator has to let you replay a match that
has already happened - "what if RCB had chased that down?" - and you cannot take
a result back out of a total that has already absorbed it. Each completed match
contributes through pointstable._booked(), the same rule the real table uses, so
with nothing overridden the rebuild reproduces the live standings exactly; there
is a test for that. Overriding one swaps that match's contribution for yours.

Speed is the feature. simulate() is built to answer inside a few hundred
milliseconds so the page can re-run on every click, which it buys by scaling the
simulation count to how much season is left (see SIM_BUDGET) rather than running
the 500k the hourly refresh can afford to.
