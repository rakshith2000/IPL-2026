"""The `main` blueprint, and the wiring that puts the site together.

This module used to hold everything - the views, the feeds, the simulation and
the helpers, in one file. It now owns only the blueprint; the rest sits in
three packages beside it:

    routes/     one module per group of views, registered on `main`
    services/   the work the views call: database, feeds, maths
    utils/      small helpers with no dependencies of their own

Season data - team names, colours, feed URLs - is in config.json.

The blueprint is created here, before the route modules are imported, because
importing them is what registers their views on it. It also stays here so the
blueprint's root path is IPL/, where the templates and static files are.
